## 435 Tivoli, Coral Gables, FL 33143

435 Tivoli was Coral Gables first contemporary home approved in 1984.  This spectacular structure was redesigned and upgraded to the maximum current standards, it is evident the moment you step up through the front door you will encounter the epitome of modernism, functional design, simple lines, double ceilings, panoramic impact windows that bring the outdoors inside. No expense spared in the renovation with a Pedini Italian designed kitchen, Wolf & Sub-Zero appliances, fully wired fiber optic cabling, security cameras, and full 6 zone audio system.  The home has been tiled in large-format Italian porcelain tile both inside and out with a full outdoor kitchen with built in Lynx Grill, outdoor LED landscaping lighting, pool with waterfall and reflecting pond and aligned landscape design, and lastly the home has a new June 2018 roof.
